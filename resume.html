        <h2>Case Study</h2>
        <p>Developed a suite of AI tools aimed at supporting climate startups in collaboration with an MIT professor, specifically for a MIT climate entrepreneurship class and broader applications. These tools leverage advanced AI capabilities to assist startups in climate policy analysis, market analysis, scoring business potential, and identifying high-impact opportunities. The project encompassed the entire development cycle from ideation, design, implementation, to launch. Secured backing from MIT's resources and engaged with various stakeholders to ensure the tools' relevance and efficacy. The tools are for use as a part of the curriculum and are being used by climate-focused entrepreneurs globally. Through this project, I honed my skills in prompt engineering, artificial intelligence, and software development.
