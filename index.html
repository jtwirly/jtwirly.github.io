            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there, I'm Jennifer Turliuk, a technology professional with a passion for both software development and prompt engineering. My vision is to create innovative and effective AI solutions that reduce climate change. I believe in pushing the boundaries of natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to create cutting-edge AI applications that positively impact society and transform industries.

With my problem-solving, analytical, and critical thinking skills, I aim to contribute to the success of projects by innovating and optimizing AI solutions. As a leader and collaborator, I strive to inspire and motivate others to achieve their full potential and make a meaningful difference in the world of technology.

During my career, I've developed expertise in programming, natural language processing, and AI design, with proficiency in Python, Flask, Django, JavaScript, Node, React, TypeScript, NextJS, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with machine learning and deep learning algorithms, with proficiency in PyTorch and other AI frameworks.

In addition, I have experience with APIs and tools such as OpenAI/GPT3, Google Cloud Natural Language, Hugging Face Transformers, and other NLP libraries. I'm also familiar with cloud platforms such as AWS, and I'm proficient with GitHub, Heroku, Git, Visual Studio Code, and Google Colab.

In my free time, I enjoy angel investing, attending industry conferences and workshops, volunteering for STEM education initiatives, and writing non-fiction, musicals, comedy, and plays.

If you're interested in working with me or collaborating on a project, please don't hesitate to get in touch! You can reach me at jenn.turliuk@gmail.com or through my Github profile at https://github.com/jtwirly.</p>
